Difference Between Compiler and Interpreter:
   
Compiler ::
         
              A compiler is a programming language translator which converts High Level Language program to its equivalent intermediate code.
      *It takes large amount of time it analyze the souce code.
      *Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole machine code.
      *programming language like c c++.
     * A computer program which reads code and outputs assembly code or executable code .

Interpreter::
           
        An interpreter is a programming langugae translator which converts High Level Language program to its equivalent machine code.
     *It takes less amount of time to analyze the source code.
     * Interpreter execute line by line execution.
     * Memory requirement is less in case of interpretion because, no object code is created in case of interpreter.
     *Thus interpreters are sometimes used during the development of a program.
